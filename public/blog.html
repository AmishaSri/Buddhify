                 <p>Did you notice that in Bhagavad-gita the Supreme Lord "Krishna" is preaching the divine wisdom to Arjuna who is not in his old age.
                    If this knowledge is meant for people in older age then why arjuna is getting benefitted with it.

                    then you are going the wrong way.
